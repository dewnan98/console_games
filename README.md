Minigames made using C++ on spare time

### Kinda Important Note
These games are far beyond stable any expect many bugs, such as laggy inputs, weird color changes, unresponsive program, or even sudden crashes.

### Lists of Minigames
- FlappyShit - Like Flappy Birdâ„¢ but worse, probably this one's even worse
- HitTheButton - Played osu! yet? Well it's similar, kinda
- SnakeGame - Just like that snake game on your old phone
- TypeFastGame - Type the sentences before the time runs out
